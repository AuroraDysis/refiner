Refiner improves your writings. It corrects grammar issues, adjusts tone, and offers formatting options. 
I found it useful for non-native speakers and professionals who communicate with text.

Here's a quick demo:

- Replace this text with your own.
- Optionally, choose tone and refinement instructions.
- Click the 'Refine' button.
- Watch as Refiner XXX.
- Copy XXX

It is an open-source project. The code is available on https://github.com/imankulov/refiner.

Give it a try now.`;
