        Stop Putin! Support Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

        Please support Ukraine.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you follow the news, you can see the atrocities committed by Russian
        soldiers in Ukraine. For me, it is personal. I am from Russia, and I
        have friends in Ukraine. I am terrified for them and their families, and
        I am deeply ashamed of what the Putin regime is doing using my
        country&apos;s name. I am also afraid that Ukraine is just the
        beginning. If we do not stop Putin now, he will continue to expand his
        war machine.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, the most effective way to stop Putin is to support Ukraine. There
        are many organizations, but I would recommend &quot;Come Back
        Alive&quot;. They are a reputable organization, known for their
        transparency and impactful use of funds in directly combating
        Putin&apos;s forces.
